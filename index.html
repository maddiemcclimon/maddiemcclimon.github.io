		<div><p>Hello! My name is Maddie, and my favorite breakfast is oatmeal. Although many think that a bowl of oats can be boring, I feel that they are actually one of the most versatile breakfast options. I typically enjoy my oats with loads of toppings that can be changed to fit a sweet or salty morning palate. Additionally, a bowl of oats can provide your body with essential nutrients first thing in the morning. Visit each page to learn more about oatmeal! </p></div>
